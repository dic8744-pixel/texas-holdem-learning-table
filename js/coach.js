warnFlush:' Three of one suit are on the board — be wary of opponents holding a flush.',

multiway:n=>` With ${n} opponents still in, marginal hands shrink in value — someone usually has something.`,
posEarly:p=>` You're in early position (${p}) — most of the table acts after you, so play tighter than normal.`,
posLate:p=>` You're in late position (${p}) — acting after most players is an edge, so you can play slightly looser.`,
futFirst:' After the flop you will be FIRST to act — playing every street out of position is a real handicap, so enter with a stronger range and prefer raising (to take the initiative) over flat calling.',

stFirst:' You act first on this street (out of position) — opponents get to react to you, so lean toward checking marginal hands.',

pfShove:(bb,c,pr,t,p)=>`At ${bb} BB you're in push/fold territory. ${c} (${pr}) is inside the bundled ~${t}% heuristic shoving chart from ${p} — shove rather than raise small: it maximizes fold equity and avoids being blinded out.`,
pfShortCheck:(c,p)=>`${c} is below the shoving range for ${p}, but checking is free.`,
pfShortCall:(c,e,o)=>`${c} is below a standard shoving range, but your simulated equity (${e}) comfortably beats the price (${o}).`,
pfShortFold:(bb,c,pr,t,p)=>`At ${bb} BB, ${c} (${pr}) is outside the bundled ~${t}% heuristic chart for ${p}. Fold and wait — even short, patience beats spew.`,
huPush:(bb,c,pr,t,p)=>`Heads-up at ${bb} BB effective, folding or limping gives up too much to the blinds. ${c} (${pr}) is near the bottom of the ~${t}% shove range from ${p}, but it is still a profitable all-in: you can win the pot immediately when the big blind folds, and you retain equity when called. The displayed win chance is your showdown equity if called — it is not the only reason to shove.`,
huOpen:(bb,c,p)=>`Heads-up at ${bb} BB effective is deep enough to play postflop. ${c} is playable from ${p}, but it is not a pure shove spot — open small and keep weaker hands in.`,
huCall:(bb,c,e,o)=>`Heads-up at ${bb} BB effective, calling ranges widen because there is no ladder pressure left. ${c} has about ${e} equity versus the price ${o}, so continue.`,
huFold:(bb,c,pr,t,p)=>`Heads-up at ${bb} BB effective, ${c} (${pr}) is below the ~${t}% shove/continue range for ${p}. Let this one go rather than gambling the match with pure trash.`,
pfOpen:(c,pr,t,p,pair)=>`No one has raised yet, and ${c} (${pr}) is inside the chart-based ~${t}% opening range for ${p}${pair?' once its set-mining value is counted — pocket pairs play above their raw ranking when stacks are deep, because flopping a set (~12%) is disguised and wins big pots':''}. Come in raising, not limping — it takes the initiative and can win the blinds outright.`,
pfBBfree:c=>`${c} isn't strong enough to raise from the big blind, but you see the flop for free.`,
pfOpenFold:(c,pr,t,p)=>`${c} (${pr}) is below the ~${t}% opening range for ${p}. Open-folding here is the textbook play — limping weak hands leaks chips long-term.`,
pfOpenFoldPair:(c,p)=>`${c} is a small pocket pair, but from ${p} with no raise yet it is not a good limp. Small pairs mostly want to flop a set (~12%); if the chart/depth does not support an open-raise, just fold and avoid playing a tiny pair out of position.`,
pf3bet:c=>`${c} is a premium holding (top 5%). Against a raise the standard play is to re-raise (3-bet) for value — flat calling lets weaker hands in cheaply behind you.`,
pfCallRange:(p,ct,c,pr,e,o)=>`Facing a raise, ${p} continues with roughly the top ${ct}% — ${c} (${pr}) qualifies, and your equity vs their range (${e}) covers the price (${o}).`,
pfSetMine:(c,amt,x)=>`${c} doesn't qualify on raw strength, but this is a textbook set-mine: the call is only ${amt} with ~${x}x that behind. You flop a set ~12% of the time — disguised, and it wins stacks. The 15-to-1 rule says the implied odds are there. Miss the flop, and it's an easy fold.`,
pfSetMineFold:(c,amt,x)=>`${c} is basically a set-mining hand versus this raise. You only flop a set ~12% of the time, so the call needs deep implied odds — roughly 15x the call behind. Here it costs ${amt} with only ~${x}x effective, so folding is cleaner than paying to miss most flops.`,
pfFoldRange:(ct,p,c,pr,e,o)=>`Against a raise, the ~top ${ct}% continues from ${p}; ${c} (${pr}) doesn't make it. Your equity vs a raiser's range is ~${e} needing ${o} — let it go.`,
valRiver:(e,n)=>`With ~${e} to win against ${n} opponent${n>1?'s':''}, you're likely best at showdown. Bet for value — a check wins you nothing extra, and worse hands may still pay you off.`,
valBet:(e,n)=>`With ~${e} to win against ${n} opponent${n>1?'s':''}, you're likely ahead. Bet for value — checking gives weaker hands and draws a free card to outdraw you.`,
protectBet:(h,e,n)=>`${h} is strong but vulnerable. Bet for value/protection: worse pairs, pair+draws, and straight/flush draws can pay, and checking gives them a free card. Raw equity is only ~${e} vs ${n} opponent${n>1?'s':''} because they share many outs, but betting is still better than giving a free card.`,
overcardCbet:(c,e,weakCheck)=>`${c} has two live overcards and about ${e} equity heads-up. You were the preflop aggressor${weakCheck?', and the blind made an informative check with a capped range':''}, so make a small continuation bet: worse high cards and draws can call, while weak hands may fold. Slow down if raised.`,
sidePotOvercardCbet:(c,e,s)=>`${c} has two live overcards, and ${s} is already in a side pot against the only opponent who can still act. They checked to the preflop aggressor, so make a small continuation bet for protection and fold equity; that routine check itself does not cap their range. The displayed ~${e} includes the all-in player and understates this heads-up side-pot opportunity; slow down if raised.`,
stab:e=>`Everyone has made an informative check outside the normal in-flow sequence, so their ranges look capped. With ~${e} plus that fold equity, a stab takes this pot down often. If anyone calls or check-raises, slow down: that's real strength.`,
checkedDownStab:(e,n)=>`${n===1?'Villain has':'Opponents have'} checked the free preflop option and then kept checking down. That line is heavily capped, so with ~${e} and a hand that is not pure trash, make a small stab — you do not need a big bet to pressure nothing.`,
probeStab:(e,n,o)=>`${n===1?'Villain has':'Opponents have'} checked multiple streets, so the line is capped. Even ${o?'out of position, ':''}with ~${e} and no bet to call, a small bluff/probe bet can fold air and weak showdown hands — keep it small, then shut down if raised.`,
midRiver:e=>`A decent but unspectacular ~${e}. The board is complete — betting mostly gets called by better hands. Check and try to get to showdown cheaply.`,
midCheck:e=>`A decent but unspectacular ~${e}. Not strong enough to build a big pot; check and keep the pot small while you see what develops.`,
multiwayTopPairCheck:(e,k,n)=>`You have top pair, but the ${k} kicker is vulnerable in a ${n+1}-way pot, and the preflop raiser still acts behind you. Leading folds much of the air you beat while stronger Jx and overpairs can call or raise. Check, keep their bluffs in, and decide after seeing the raiser's action. Your ~${e} equity is a share of a multiway pot, not a reason to build one immediately.`,
drySidePotCheck:(h,e)=>`${h} is strong enough to contest the main pot, but one opponent is already all-in and the side pot is still empty. On this dry board there is little to protect: checking keeps weaker hands and bluffs in, while betting would mostly build a new side pot against the only opponent who can still act. Your ~${e} equity includes the all-in player — it is not a reason to force a side pot.`,
weakRiverLast:e=>`Only ~${e} to win and no cards left to come — your hand is final. Everyone has checked to you: check behind and take the free showdown.`,
weakRiverFirst:e=>`Only ~${e} to win and no cards left to come — your hand can't improve anymore. Check, and fold to any serious bet.`,
weakFree:e=>`Only ~${e} to win, but checking costs nothing. Take the free card and fold to any serious bet.`,
bigBet:r=>` This bet is ≈${r}% of the pot — bets that large are usually made hands (two pair or better), so the coach discounts your raw win chance here.`,
gutWarn:' Chasing a 4-out gutshot into big bets is a long-term money leak — even when you hit, you may not get paid enough to cover all the misses (poor implied odds).',
airWarn:' You have no made hand and no real draw — players who bet usually have at least a pair, and "pot-odds correct" calls with high cards are one of the biggest leaks in poker. The coach heavily discounts your raw win chance here.',
weakDrawWarn:' You have no made hand and only a weak gutshot — those four outs are included in the equity, but this is not a strong draw like an open-ender or flush draw. The coach discounts it heavily against aggression.',
underpairRealization:(n,pen,size,oop,backdoors,commit,spr)=>` Your pocket pair sits below ${n} distinct board rank${n>1?'s':''}. ${oop?'Out of position, ':''}facing a ${size}%-pot bet with more betting still possible, raw showdown equity overstates how often you can profitably reach the river.${commit>=25?` Calling also commits ${commit}% of your remaining stack and leaves an SPR of only ~${spr}, so the next barrel is highly leveraged.`:''} The coach removes about ${pen} equity points${backdoors?' after giving some credit to your backdoor possibilities':''}.`,
fragileFlushCheck:(tuple,higher,danger,continued,n)=>` This is a low ${tuple} flush on a four-flush board, not a nut flush: ${higher} higher suited card${higher!==1?'s':''} remain available. Across ${n} opponent${n>1?'s':''}, the modeled chance that someone already has a better flush is about ${danger}; against hands willing to continue versus a real bet, this hand is ahead only about ${continued}. Check for pot control — betting folds too much worse and concentrates action in better flushes.`,
rangeLikelyHands:(n,h)=>` ${n}'s most likely hand classes after the full action history: ${h}. Percentages are their normalized share of the current range, after known-card blockers — not a claim that one exact hand is certain.`,
raiseVal:e=>`~${e} to win is a strong favorite. Raise for value and to charge draws — flat calling leaves money on the table.`,
postflopRaiseSize:(amt,bb,x,bet,ratio)=>` Suggested postflop raise size: ${amt} (${bb}). The opponent's bet is about ${ratio}% pot, so use roughly ${x}x that bet: small bets can be raised much larger, while big bets and overbets usually only need about 2-3x.`,
callOk:(amt,pt,o,e,disc,ea,need)=>`The call costs ${amt} to win a ${pt} pot, so the immediate price needs ${o} equity. After position, prize pressure and realistic implied odds, the effective requirement is ~${need}; you have ~${e}${disc?` (counted as ~${ea} after hand-strength discounts)`:''}. Calling is profitable long-term, but raising would risk too much with a non-premium hand.`,
foldAdv:(o,amt,pt,ea,resp,need)=>`The immediate price needs ${o} equity to call (${amt} into ${pt}). After position, prize pressure and realistic implied odds, the effective requirement is ~${need}, but your usable equity is only ~${ea}${resp?' once this bet size is respected':''}. Fold and wait for a better spot.`,
impliedOddsNote:(now,real,best,future,max,hit,reverse)=>` Implied odds: the immediate price needs ${now}. With about ${hit} to hit a clean out and up to ${max} still available behind, the coach conservatively credits about ${future} of future payment; that lowers the realistic break-even price to ~${real}. The absolute best case is ${best} if every remaining chip is paid${reverse?' — but the non-nut draw also carries reverse-implied-odds risk, so that best case is not used':''}.`,
chart3bet:(c,e)=>`${c} is in the bundled re-raise (3-bet) chart against ${e?'an early-position raiser':'a late-position raiser'} — this heuristic chart re-raises big pairs for value and hands like A5s as "blocker bluffs" (your ace makes monster hands less likely). Flat-calling would let players behind you in cheaply.`,
shortAllInValue:(c,b,n)=>`${c} is strong enough to isolate this ${b} BB all-in for value. The all-in player cannot fold, so this is not a chart bluff: the raise charges the ${n} live player${n!==1?'s':''} behind for entering the main pot.`,
shortAllInCall:(c,b,r,u,n,x)=>`${c} has enough equity to call this ${b} BB all-in at the offered price. Raw equity is ${r} and remains about ${u} because the main pot is guaranteed to reach showdown${n?`; the adjusted ${x} requirement still includes the risk from ${n} live player${n!==1?'s':''} behind`:''}. Call — do not turn a hand with adequate price into a 3-bet bluff against someone who cannot fold.`,
shortAllInFold:(c,b,r,u,n,x)=>`${c} cannot profitably call this ${b} BB all-in. The all-in player cannot fold or offer future implied odds: raw equity is ${r}, about ${u} after the remaining risk, below the adjusted ${x} requirement${n?` with ${n} live player${n!==1?'s':''} still involved`:''}. Fold; the ordinary 3-bet bluff chart does not apply to an all-in.`,
squeezePlay:(c,n)=>`${c} is a squeeze: one player raised and ${n} caller${n>1?'s have':' has'} put dead money in with a usually capped hand. Re-raise large enough to pressure both; you can win now, and this hand still has value when called.`,
dominatedTopPair:(k,n)=>` Top pair is useful, but the ${k} kicker is vulnerable: ${n} higher kicker${n>1?'s are':' is'} still possible. Avoid turning one pair into a huge pot against strong action.`,
madeCounterfeit:(r,n)=>` Your two pair is vulnerable to counterfeiting: ${n} remaining ${r}${n>1?'s':''} pair the high board card and can make your smaller pair stop playing. Bet for value/protection, but reassess if that card arrives.`,
textureSize:(kind,p)=>` Board-aware sizing: this is a ${kind} board, so the suggested bet uses about ${p}% pot — smaller on safe boards, larger when draws need charging.`,
floatPlan:` This flop call is a float with a plan, not a hopeful call: you have position and enough equity to continue, then can attack many turn checks. If the opponent barrels again or the turn strongly favors their range, shut down.`,
turnPlan:k=>` Turn plan: ${k==='value'?'strong value — keep building the pot':k==='draw'?'strong draw — semi-bluff only when fold equity is credible':k==='control'?'medium strength — control the pot and avoid a huge river decision':'weak hand — stop investing without a clear bluff opportunity'}.`,
riverBlockerBluff:` River blocker bluff: your ace removes the nut-flush hands from the opponent's range, while their passive line contains many folds. Use a small, disciplined bluff; this is not permission to bluff a player who calls too often.`,
fourBetFold:(c,amt,bb,eff,read)=>`This is not a 3-bet spot: you already raised and now face a 3-bet to ${amt} (${bb}). ${c} is not strong enough to continue${read?' against this large/tight line':''}. The ace blocker can make it an occasional 4-bet bluff against a normal, wide 3-bet when stacks are deep, but at ${eff} BB effective this sizing commits too much — fold.`,
fourBetValue:(c,amt,bb)=>`You already raised and now face a 3-bet to ${amt} (${bb}). ${c} belongs to the value 4-bet range; with this much already in the middle, use a committed raise rather than an awkward size that leaves a tiny stack behind.`,
fourBetBluff:(c,amt,bb)=>`You already raised and now face a 3-bet to ${amt} (${bb}). ${c} can be used as a selective 4-bet bluff here: your ace blocks AA/AK, the 3-bettor's range is wide, the size is still normal, and stacks are deep enough to fold if shoved on.`,
fourBetCall:(c,e,o)=>`You already raised and now face a 3-bet. ${c} is strong enough to continue but does not want to build a 4-bet pot; call with ${e} equity versus a ${o} price.`,
chartCallRaise:(c,e,o)=>`${c} is in the calling chart against this raise — strong enough to see a flop, not strong enough to re-raise. Your win chance (${e}) covers the price (${o}). Call, and play carefully if you miss the flop.`,
pfContextCall:(c,raw,usable,need,open,eff,pos,behind,sq)=>`${c} is a contextual call, not an automatic defend. Against a ${open} BB open at ${eff} BB effective, you will be ${pos>0?'in position':pos<0?'out of position':'without guaranteed last action'} after the flop${behind?`, with ${behind} player${behind>1?'s':''} still able to squeeze`:''}. Raw equity of ${raw} becomes about ${usable} after position, stack depth, implied/reverse-implied odds and the modeled ${sq}% squeeze risk; that still clears the adjusted ${need} requirement.`,
pfContextFold:(c,raw,usable,need,open,eff,pos,behind,sq)=>`${c} may look playable on a static chart, but this exact call is not profitable. Against a ${open} BB open at ${eff} BB effective, you will be ${pos>0?'in position':pos<0?'out of position':'without guaranteed last action'} after the flop${behind?`, and ${behind} player${behind>1?'s':''} can still squeeze`:''}. Raw equity of ${raw} falls to about ${usable} once realization, implied/reverse-implied odds and ${sq}% squeeze risk are counted, below the adjusted ${need} requirement — fold.`,
pfMultiwayValue:(c,n)=>`${n} caller${n>1?'s':''} improve the immediate price for ${c}. This hand retains its equity relatively well multiway and can make a strong disguised hand, so the coach gives it a small, capped implied-odds credit when stacks are deep enough. The benefit is not unlimited: every extra opponent still lowers raw equity and adds non-nut and reverse-implied-odds risk.`,
chartIcmFold:(c,e,o)=>`${c} is normally a call here, but right now your simulated win chance (${e}) doesn't cover the price (${o}) once prize pressure and this raiser's range are counted. The chart is a guide — the math of THIS table says fold.`,
chartFoldVs:(c,r,b,d)=>`${c} is outside both the re-raise and calling ranges versus this ${r||'position'} open.${d?' A weak suited ace is often dominated by the opener’s stronger aces, creating costly reverse implied odds.':''}${b?` ${b} player${b>1?'s':''} behind can still squeeze or enter the pot.`:''} The equity estimate is close, but equity alone does not override the position-specific range — fold.`,
broadwayFlat:(c,o,s,b)=>`${c} is a connected or one-gap high-card hand facing a small ${o} BB raise. Under the wider multiway-building strategy, call this price with ${s} BB behind${b?` even though ${b} player${b>1?'s':''} can still enter`:''}. This is an intentional loose/exploit adjustment, not the bundled baseline chart; fold the same hand to a larger raise or with a shorter stack.`,
chartOpen:(c,p)=>`${c} is in the bundled ${p} opening chart — a heuristic baseline for first-in decisions. Come in raising, not limping.`,
chartIso:(c,p,n)=>`${c} is in the bundled ${p} iso chart — a heuristic range for raising over ${n} limper${n>1?'s':''}. Isolate with a raise; calling behind limpers bleeds chips.`,
chartNotInIso:(c,p)=>`${c} is not in the ${p} iso chart — even over limpers, this hand loses money as a raise long-term. Fold, or make a very tight exception only with a huge stack edge.`,
limpPotNote:n=>` ${n} limper${n>1?'s':''} — dead money widens iso-raise ranges slightly, but speculative suited connectors need position/depth before you build a big pot.`,
pfRaiseSize:(amt,bb,pos,callers,anteAdj,depthAdj,effBB)=>` Suggested preflop size: ${amt} (${bb}). ${pos==='IP'?'In position, start at 3 BB':'Out of position, start at 4 BB'} and add 1 BB per limper (${callers} here)${anteAdj?'; antes add dead money':''}${depthAdj>0?'; deep effective stacks support a small increase':effBB?`; the ~${effBB} BB effective stack needs no deep-stack increase`:''}.`,
pfOpenSize:(amt,bb,pos,antes)=>` Suggested open size: ${amt} (${bb}). ${pos==='IP'?(antes?'Antes add enough dead money to move the in-position baseline from 3 BB to 4 BB.':'With no antes, the in-position first-in baseline is 3 BB.'):'The out-of-position first-in baseline remains 4 BB.'}`,
threeBetSize:(amt,bb,open,callers,pos)=>` Suggested 3-bet size: ${amt} (${bb}) — ${pos==='IP'?'3× in position':'4× out of position'} over the ${open} opening raise${callers?`, plus 1× for each of the ${callers} flat caller${callers>1?'s':''}`:''}.`,
fourBetSize:(amt,bb,x)=>` Suggested 4-bet size: ${amt} (${bb}), about ${x}x the 3-bet. This is deliberately much smaller than a 3x 3-bet sizing; if that size would commit roughly 40% of the effective stack, the clean choice with a value hand is all-in instead.`,
chartNotIn:(c,p)=>`${c} is not in the bundled ${p} heuristic opening chart. Folding now saves chips for a better spot.`,
chartShove:(c,bb,p)=>`At ${bb} BB, ${c} is in the bundled ${p} heuristic all-in chart. Going all-in maximizes your chance of winning the blinds and antes uncontested.`,
chartNotInShove:(c,p)=>`${c} is not in the ${p} all-in chart for this stack depth — shoving it loses money long-term. Fold and wait: even one round of patience usually offers a better hand.`,
benchProg:(i,n)=>`Running… tournament ${i} of ${n}`,
benchResult:(g,np,w,rw,im,ri,av,rav)=>`Over ${g} simulated ${np}-player tournaments, a bot following the coach's advice on EVERY decision: 🏆 won ${w}% of tournaments (a random player would win ${rw}%) · 💰 finished in the money ${im}% (random: ${ri}%) · average finish ${av} of ${np} (random: ${rav}). The coach can't beat luck in one game — but this is its long-term edge.`,
mentalMath:(c,s,o)=>` 🧮 Live mental math: price = call ÷ (pot + call) = ${c} ÷ ${s} ≈ ${o}. Your win%: count outs (cards that improve you to the best hand) × 4 on the flop, × 2 on the turn; with a made hand, estimate how often you beat what they'd bet like this. Then knock off ~5–15% versus big bets or with no pair — the same discounts the coach applied here.`,
mWarn:(n,m,z)=>` Blinds go up in ${n} hand${n>1?'s':''} — your M drops to ~${m} (${z}). Look for spots now rather than being forced to gamble later.`,
mExplain:m=>` What "M = ${m}" means: your stack divided by the cost of one full round of blinds and antes — i.e. you could survive ${m} more rounds folding everything. Above 20 🟢 play your normal game; 10–20 🟡 start fighting for pots; 5–10 🟠 favor shoving over small raises; under 5 🔴 it's all-in or fold.`,
cashModeNote:` Fixed blinds in cash — chip EV equals real money EV here (no ICM or prize pressure).`,
diffEasy:` AI difficulty: Easy opponents are noisier and call too wide, but their big aggression is usually less balanced. The coach trusts exact range reads less, value-bets thinner, and bluffs less.`,
diffHard:` AI difficulty: Hard opponents are more position-aware and balanced. Their aggression can include more bluffs, so the coach gives c-bets and late-position pressure less automatic credit.`,
cashDeepNote:bb=>` At ${bb} BB deep in cash, implied odds matter: pocket pairs and suited connectors play bigger than their rank suggests, and you can widen steals in position — but blinds never rise, so play for value and avoid bloating pots out of position without equity.`,
cashDeepIp:bb=>` In position at ${bb} BB, you can open wider and stab after informative checks or check-backs — deep stacks let callers continue with medium hands, so pressure genuinely capped ranges; still fold trash to big raises.`,
sprDeep:s=>` SPR ~${s} (deep) — implied odds are live: sets and draws can win big pots; one pair alone is rarely worth stacking off unless the board is dry.`,
sprMid:s=>` SPR ~${s} (medium) — top pair+ can stack off vs aggression; draws need correct odds; don't inflate pots OOP with marginal made hands.`,
sprLow:s=>` SPR ~${s} (low) — you're committed territory: one pair or better often has to get the money in; don't float wide hoping to improve.`,
chartBb3bet:(c,v)=>`${c} is in the BB defense chart (${v}) — 3-bet for value or as a blocker bluff vs this steal.`,
chartBbCall:(c,v,e,o)=>`${c} is in the BB calling range vs ${v} — defend wide enough that steals can't print money. Your equity (${e}) covers the price (${o}).`,
chartBbFold:(c,v)=>`${c} is outside the BB defense chart vs ${v} — folding saves chips; calling trash from the BB is a classic cash-game leak.`,
widenNote:(b,e,d)=>` Rising blinds and dead money change the math: your normal ~${b}% opening range here is adjusted to ~${e}%${d===1?' — and the players left to act fold too much, so attack them':d===-1?' — tempered, because the players left to act defend wide, so steal less into them':''}.`,
tableSizeNote:(n,b,e)=>` Only ${n} players remain, so preflop ranges are not full-ring ranges anymore: this seat's baseline range moves from about ${b}% to about ${e}% before the other live adjustments.`,
stackDomNote:(r,c,n)=>` You have ~${r}× the largest stack and cover ${c} of ${n} opponents still in — shorter stacks fold more often, so the coach widens steal/iso ranges slightly. Calling marginal hands is still a leak; raise or fold.`,
stackDomIso:(c,p,r)=>`${c} is outside the standard ${p} chart, but with ~${r}× the table's biggest stack you can iso-raise as a pressure play — shorter stacks can't gamble back easily. Raise, don't call.`,
stackDomCall:(c,r,e,o)=>`${c} is a chart defend and you are the clear chip leader (~${r}× the next stack). The raw sim is close (${e} vs ${o} price), and the call is small relative to your stack, so continue instead of over-folding to short-stack pressure.`,
stackDomFoldHint:` Your stack edge makes an iso-raise possible here, but this hand is still too weak even for that line. Fold — patience preserves your advantage.`,
